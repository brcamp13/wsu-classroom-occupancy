# classroom-occupancy

## Personally, I sometimes like to sit on random lectures instead of going to my own
## Sometimes, I don't care about the topic of the random lecture, but care more about the location
## The school provides a list of classrooms in use at particular times, but not which classes are using them
## As such, the purpose of this is to scrape data from schedules.wsu.edu to list classrooms and their occupancy status with specific information about which classes are meeting
